- Improved/additional off-axis measurements
    - How far off axis can we go and still maintain DCI-P3?
        - Gamut will remain unchanged with viewing angle, but native WB and calibration will be off. Larger ∆E at angle
    - How far off axis can we go and still maintain 90% of luminance?
    - Threshold for 5∆E Off Axis
