- Reflectance
    - What is actual impact on dynamic range of e.g., 3.5% to 2.5% improvement
        - Can be calculated, but best demonstrated with a footage test
    - Understand impact of real-world spill light, and when it overcomes content
    - Camera tests to demonstrate loss in DR with respect to reflectance and flare (Lighting)
	    - Can #TimKang help organize and plan this?
